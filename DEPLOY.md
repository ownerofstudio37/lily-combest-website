## 📋 Pre-Launch Checklist

## 🌐 DNS & Domain Setup

### Point Domain to Netlify
1. Go to your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
2. Update DNS records to point to Netlify:
   - **A Record**: `lilycombest.com` → `75.3.110.61` (or current Netlify IP)
   - **CNAME**: `www` → `lilycombest.netlify.app`
3. Wait 15-60 minutes for DNS to propagate (check with [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org))

### Setup Netlify Custom Domain
1. Netlify dashboard > Site settings > Domain management > Add custom domain
2. Enter `lilycombest.com`
3. Netlify will auto-generate an SSL certificate (HTTPS enabled)
4. Verify domain propagation in Netlify

### Resend Email Domain Verification
1. Resend dashboard > Domains > your domain (`hello.lillycombest.com`)
2. Add the DNS records provided by Resend to your domain registrar
3. Wait for verification (typically 5-15 minutes)
4. Once verified, emails from the contact form will send successfully
