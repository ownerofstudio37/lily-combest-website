# Lilly Combest — Health & Wellness (Pinehurst, TX)

This repository is a fresh starter for Lilly Combest — a health and wellness consultant based in Pinehurst, Texas. It’s inspired by a previous website template but has been sanitized and rebranded so you can build a site specific to Lilly's services.

## Quick start

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Start local dev server: `npm run dev`
- Build for production: `npm run build`
- Start production server: `npm run start`

## What’s included

- Minimal Next.js starter configuration
- Netlify preview config (`netlify.toml`) with a placeholder site URL
- `scripts/sanitize.sh` — helper script to sweep and replace leftover mentions of Studio37 in copied text (run manually)
- Content guide files to help create copy for Lily
- A minimal Next.js App Router scaffold with basic `Hero` and `Services` components (see `app/`)

---

⚠️ This is a starter scaffold. Customize the content, branding, and environment variables to match Lily Combest's business and preferred domain before deploying.

## Next steps

1. Install dependencies: `npm install` and add Tailwind + PostCSS if you want Tailwind styles (`npm i -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`) then run `npx tailwindcss init -p` if not using the included config.
2. Run dev server: `npm run dev` (Next.js 14 or compatible required).
3. Replace placeholder images, emails, and domain (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`) with Lily's actual values before deploying.
4. If you want, I can copy more pages/components from the original Studio37 site and adapt them for Lily — tell me which parts to bring over.
