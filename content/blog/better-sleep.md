Quality sleep is one of the most underrated wellness tools. Yet many of us struggle to get restorative rest. Here are five simple habits to improve your sleep starting tonight.

## 1. Set a Consistent Bedtime

Your body loves routine. Going to bed and waking at the same time every day (yes, even weekends) helps regulate your circadian rhythm and improves sleep quality over time.

## 2. Dim the Lights 30 Minutes Before Bed

Bright light signals your brain to stay awake. Dimming lights or using a blue-light filter on your phone helps your body produce melatonin naturally, making it easier to fall asleep.

## 3. Avoid Heavy Meals Late in the Evening

Large meals close to bedtime can disrupt sleep as your digestive system works hard. Aim to eat dinner 2-3 hours before bed, and keep late-night snacks light.

## 4. Move Your Body During the Day

Regular movement improves sleep depth and reduces the time it takes to fall asleep. Even a 20-minute walk during the day can make a noticeable difference.

## 5. Create a Cool, Dark Sleep Environment

Your bedroom should be a sleep sanctuary — cool (around 65-68°F), dark, and quiet. Invest in blackout curtains or an eye mask if needed.

## The Compound Effect

None of these habits are revolutionary on their own, but together they signal to your body that sleep is a priority. Start with one or two, and add more as they become automatic. Within a few weeks, you'll likely notice improved energy, mood, and focus.

Sweet dreams!
