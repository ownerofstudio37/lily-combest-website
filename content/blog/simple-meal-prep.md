Meal prepping doesn't have to be complicated. With just a few hours on Sunday, you can set yourself up for success during the week.

## Why Meal Prep?

When you have healthy meals ready to go, you're less likely to reach for convenience foods or skip meals altogether. This simple habit can transform your energy levels, sleep quality, and overall wellness.

## The Basics

Start with 3 components for each meal:
- **Protein**: Grilled chicken, baked tofu, or hard-boiled eggs
- **Whole grains**: Brown rice, quinoa, or sweet potatoes
- **Vegetables**: Roasted broccoli, leafy greens, or seasonal veggies

## Pro Tips

1. **Batch cook proteins** — Cook 2-3 pounds of chicken at once and portion into containers
2. **Use your freezer** — Prepped meals last 3-4 days in the fridge, or freeze for later
3. **Keep it simple** — Don't overthink it; the best meal plan is one you'll actually follow
4. **Label everything** — Write the prep date so you know when it was made

Give it a try this week and notice how much easier it becomes to make healthy choices throughout the day.
